# Task Management API

## Overview

The Task Management API is a lightweight and efficient backend service built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It supports basic task management functionality, including user authentication, CRUD operations for tasks, and pagination for better data handling.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup, login, and password reset functionality.
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Pagination**: Fetch tasks efficiently with page and limit query parameters.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and user roles for restricted operations.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v14 or newer)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or cloud instance)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:

```env
PORT=1300
DATABASE=<your_mongo_db_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
```

Replace `<your_mongo_db_connection_string>` and `<your_jwt_secret>` with actual values.

---

## Running the API

### Start the Server

To start the server in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:1300`.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST** `/signup`: Register a new user.
- **POST** `/login`: Log in to an existing account.

### Tasks
- **GET** `/tasks`: Fetch all tasks (supports `page` and `limit` query parameters for pagination).
- **POST** `/tasks`: Create a new task (requires authentication).
- **GET** `/tasks/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific task by ID (requires authentication).
- **PUT** `/tasks/:id`: Update an entire task by ID (requires authentication).
- **PATCH** `/tasks/:id`: Update specific fields of a task by ID (requires authentication).
- **DELETE** `/tasks/:id`: Delete a task by ID (requires authentication).

## Notes

- Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible.
- Use a strong JWT secret for production.

Enjoy building with the Task Management API! ðŸš€
